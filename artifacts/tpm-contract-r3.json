    "problemStatement": "Users need a browser-based web application to access their PC camera, view live feed, and capture photos and videos through a simple, intuitive interface.",
    "goals": [
      "Enable users to activate their PC camera from within a web browser",
      "Provide real-time camera feed display",
      "Allow users to capture still photos from the camera feed in JPEG format",
      "Allow users to record video from the camera feed in MP4 format (or WebM for Safari)",
      "Support video recordings up to 30 minutes in length",
      "Provide intuitive and easy-to-use interface for camera selection and capture",
      "Support maximum available camera resolution including 720p, 1080p, and 4K"
    ],
    "nonGoals": [
      "Mobile native application development",
      "Offline camera access",
      "Advanced photo/video editing features",
      "Cloud storage integration",

Files automatically download as JPEG (photos) and MP4 or WebM (videos) to browser's default download folder with standardized naming format (CamerApp-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS.extension). Support for up to 30-minute video recordings with proper tab closure/switching behavior. Photo capture disabled during video recording. Photo capture debounced to maximum 1 per second. Video uses standard bitrates for selected resolution. Minimum hardware: 2GB RAM, 2-core CPU, 720p camera. Cameras below 720p not supported. Error handling includes folder selection when default download location inaccessible. No file size limitations within 30-minute constraint. Advanced features like editing, filters, or cloud storage deferred to future iterations. Stakeholder approval sufficient for launch.",
