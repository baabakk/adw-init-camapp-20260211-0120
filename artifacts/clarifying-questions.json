      "question": "What video bitrate and quality settings should be used for recordings at different resolutions (720p, 1080p, 4K)?",
      "context": "Video quality settings directly impact file size, memory usage, and browser performance during 30-minute recordings. This is critical for the NFR-11 requirement about handling long recordings without memory overflow.",

      "question": "What should happen when a user attempts to capture a photo while video recording is in progress?",
      "context": "Edge case identified but behavior not specified. This affects FR-06 and FR-07 implementation and could impact user experience if not handled correctly.",

      "id": "CQ-03",
      "section": "requirements",
      "question": "What is the expected behavior when multiple captures occur within the same second, causing file name collisions?",
      "context": "File naming format (CamerApp-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS.extension) only has second-level precision. Rapid captures could create conflicts, affecting FR-18 and NFR-14.",

      "context": "AC-18 is marked as non-testable, but this is a must-have NFR-07 requirement. Need concrete metrics like task completion time, error rate, or user testing criteria for validation.",

      "section": "risksAndDependencies",
      "question": "What are the minimum PC hardware specifications (CPU, RAM, GPU) required to support 4K video recording for 30 minutes?",
      "context": "4K recording for extended duration is resource-intensive. Without minimum specs, we risk deployment failures on lower-end hardware, affecting NFR-11 and the 30-minute recording requirement.",

      "id": "CQ-06",
      "section": "requirements",
      "question": "What should happen when the camera provides a lower resolution than the requested maximum (e.g., camera only supports 720p but 1080p was requested)?",
      "context": "FR-22 requires requesting maximum resolution, but fallback behavior is not specified. This affects user expectations and error messaging (FR-23).",

      "section": "deliveryIntent",
      "question": "What is the testing strategy for validating 30-minute video recordings, given the aggressive one-week timeline?",
      "context": "30-minute recording tests are time-consuming and critical for AC-17. With a one-week delivery timeline, testing strategy must be defined upfront to ensure adequate coverage without blocking release.",

      "id": "CQ-08",
      "section": "requirements",
      "question": "What maximum file sizes should be enforced for photos and videos to prevent storage issues?",
      "context": "30-minute 4K videos can exceed several GB. Without file size limits, users may encounter storage failures mid-recording, affecting FR-14, FR-15, and the edge case for insufficient storage.",
      "priority": "important"
    }
  ],
  "summary": "The contract is well-structured but has critical gaps around video quality settings, resource constraints for 4K recording, and edge case behaviors that will directly impact implementation. The aggressive one-week timeline makes it essential to clarify these technical specifications immediately, particularly video encoding parameters and hardware requirements. Additionally, the 'intuitive UI' requirement needs measurable success criteria to validate against NFR-07 before launch."
